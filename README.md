Project Overview
This project provides all required work for the Statistical Computing and Reporting course. It stores tasks from all chapters in Python and R. The work covers data entry, arrays, matrices, data frames, summary statistics, model fitting, visual reports, and structured code design. Each section follows the same layout in both languages to help you compare and review the results in a simple way. The goal is to show clear statistical processes using small programs that run fast and give accurate output.

Project Structure
BasicsOfData
Contains simple operations that show arithmetic, variables, functions, and small data structures. This section prepares you for later work involving arrays and data frames.

Arrays and DataFrames
Covers arrays, matrices, data frames, indexing, cleaning, structure checks, grouping, and summary statistics. It also includes simple modeling tasks and related numerical processes.

Plots
Stores all graphs produced by the Python and R scripts. These files include scatter plots, line plots, fitted lines, and other visual summaries based on the data used in the scripts.

Python Work
The Python section applies numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. It runs the same tasks done in R but in Python syntax. You learn how to load data, inspect data, clean data, compute summary values, build basic models, process arrays, and generate graphs saved to the plots folder. Each script produces clear output that you can read in your terminal.

R Work
The R section uses native R features for arrays, matrices, lists, and data frames. It produces descriptive summaries and visual reports. It includes matrix operations, object inspection, simple models, eigenvalue work, and plots saved to the plots folder. Each script runs from the command line for consistent workflow.

Software Requirements
Python 3.11 or newer
R with required libraries
A working terminal that supports simple commands
Installed libraries listed in requirements.txt for Python
Installed R packages when needed

How to Run Python Scripts

Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate

Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run basic tasks
python BasicsOfData/math_operations.py

Run array and data frame tasks
python Arrays and DataFrames/arrays_and_data_frames.py
Plots appear in the plots folder.

How to Run R Scripts

Run basic tasks
Rscript BasicsOfData/math_operations.R

Run arrays and data frame tasks
Rscript Arrays and DataFrames/Arrays and Data Frames.r
The scripts produce all required summaries and graphs.
Graphs appear in the plots folder.

Troubleshooting
If Python reports a missing library, activate your environment and reinstall requirements.
If R reports a missing package, install the package using install.packages inside R.
If folder names contain spaces, make sure you use quotes when running scripts.

Project Purpose
This repository helps students understand statistical tasks through simple programs. It shows how each step works in both Python and R. It supports learning by practice. Each script is short and readable. It is designed for fast revision and clear reporting. It matches the instructions provided by the course director.
