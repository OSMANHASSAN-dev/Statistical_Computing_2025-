# Project Overview
This repository contains all required work for the Statistical Computing and Reporting course. The project includes Python and R code for data operations, arrays, matrices, data frames, summaries, numerical tasks, simple models, and visual reports. The structure helps you compare results across both languages. Each script is short and clear for fast review and learning.

# Project Structure

# BasicsOfData
This folder contains simple tasks that show variables, arithmetic, functions, and small data structures. These tasks prepare you for later work with arrays and data frames.

# Arrays and DataFrames
This folder covers arrays, matrices, indexing, cleaning, structure checks, grouping, summaries, and simple models. It also includes tasks that show how numerical operations work in Python and R.

# Plots
This folder stores all graphs produced by the scripts. The graphs include scatter plots, line plots, fitted lines, and simple visual summaries.

# Python Work
The Python code uses numpy, pandas, and matplotlib. It repeats the tasks done in R. You learn data loading, cleaning, structure checks, summaries, simple modeling, and graph creation. All graphs are saved in the plots folder. The output is simple to read in the terminal.

# R Work
The R code uses base R for arrays, matrices, lists, and data frames. It shows descriptive summaries, matrix operations, object inspection, simple models, eigenvalue work, and plots saved in the plots folder. All scripts run from the command line.

# Software Requirements
Python 3.11 or newer
R and required libraries
A terminal that supports standard commands
Python libraries from requirements.txt
R packages installed as needed

# How to Run Python Scripts
Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run basic tasks
python BasicsOfData/math_operations.py

# Run arrays and data frames tasks
python Arrays and DataFrames/arrays_and_data_frames.py

# All graphs appear in the plots folder.

How to Run R Scripts
Run basic tasks
Rscript BasicsOfData/math_operations.R

Run arrays and data frames tasks
Rscript Arrays and DataFrames/Arrays and Data Frames.r

# All graphs appear in the plots folder.

# Troubleshooting
If Python reports a missing library, activate your environment and reinstall requirements.
If R reports a missing package, install it using install.packages.
If your script path contains spaces, place the file path inside quotes.

# Project Purpose
This project helps students understand statistical work through simple and clear code. It shows how each step operates in Python and R. It supports personal study, group work, and reporting for the course. It follows the instructions provided by the course director.
This repository helps students understand statistical tasks through simple programs. It shows how each step works in both Python and R. It supports learning by practice. Each script is short and readable. It is designed for fast revision and clear reporting. It matches the instructions provided by the course director.
